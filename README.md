# libsamplerate

`libsamplerate` is a pure [C2Rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust)-transpiled version of
libsamplerate. This should be a drop-in replacement to [libsamplerate-sys](https://github.com/Prior99/libsamplerate-sys).

## \#[no_std]
The project should be relatively simple to port to no_std. If you require that feature, please start
an issue.
